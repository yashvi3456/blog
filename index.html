              <p class="text-mute text-left text-capatalize">New Zealand lies in the Pacific Ocean, to the southwest. New Zealand promises beautiful landscapes and serene, equally beautiful coastlines that you can drive along, listening to the sound of the surf. The country is also known for its adventure sports activities as well as its museums, art galleries and other heritage attractions.These are New Zealand's summer months. They are considered the best months during which to visit the country. Relaxing at the beach, hiking and other adventure activities are best enjoyed during this time frame. There are also a lot of concerts and festivals that take place during this period, so you can make the most of your journey.December heralds the beginning of the Kiwi summer and the sun comes out in all its might, and with it so do the international tourists escaping winter from the world over. Parties pop up all over the country, barbecues and pavlova become Kiwi staples over the month, and the long days are celebrated well into the nights. 
               International tourists throng to New Zealand to celebrate Christmas in a sultry summer environment rather than the winter wonderlands that typically dominate Christmas celebrations.  </p>

        <p>The superheroes in Chloé Zhao’s Eternals are bound to each other by many things, starting with the interlocking rings and shafts and bolts of golden light that emanate from their very being. The light — a cosmic energy they share — is the piping that lines their uniforms, and it’s the shape-shifting weaponry they conjure to battle the Deviants (gnashing, fast-break monsters that resemble dinosaurs with everything but their sinew and bone stripped away). That filigreed network of light, floating and darting through the air, serves many purposes, and it’s the most tangible figment of Chloé Zhao’s artistry — her way of grabbing hold of the vast machinery of a $200 million comic-book franchise movie and turning it into something elegant and aesthetic, with visual effects that dance before your eyes.</p>

       <p>Lion King is a masterpiece story that has been celebrated for years for its emotional and timeless value. This version falls really short. The voice acting is flat the tone is wrong and there is little to no emotion felt during a very slow boring few hours. The only highlight in my opinion is Seth Rohan and Billy Eisner.</p>
